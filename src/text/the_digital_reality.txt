Companies such as Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp are receiving valuations 10-15x their projected revenues. However, their growth rates and profit margins greatly outperform those of the companies within 'reasonable' revenue multiple through leveraging networks. Technology has shifted the value from tangible assets to intangible assets (e.g. software, networks, and data). The only way to keep up with this trend is to think outside of traditional business models and understand technology not as another department, but as a literacy. I want to build a consultancy that teaches organizations to embrace technology through collaborative problem solving.
