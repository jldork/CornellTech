What inspired me the most about code, was the ability to turn an idea into reality. With the little shell scripting I had learned in my first few months at Capital One, I created a web scraper to email me curated weekend events in the DC area. With excitement, I began to participate in code meetups and hackathons (e.g. Open Data Day). Besides what I build for work, I have worked on side-projects for my own personal learning or to contribute to the open-source community. I am inspired by the Open Data, Open Source, and Maker movements, looking to contribute in any way I can.
