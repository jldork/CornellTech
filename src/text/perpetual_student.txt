If you had asked me when I graduated in 2013, I would not have believed that I would code, much less build applications. I had studied mechanical engineering and was more interested in data-driven business strategy. However, when I began working at Capital One, I learned a small amount of shell scripting in order to manage data on remote servers. This piqued my curiosity and led me to learn Python after work and on weekends. After a year of data manipulation in Python, I volunteered to be a developer on an internal product, where I learned web application development and deployment.
