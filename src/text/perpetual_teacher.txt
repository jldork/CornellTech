At the same time, I wanted to bring my fellow analysts along for the journey and demonstrate to them the power of code. During my first two years, I created the first GitHub (code collaboration tool) and Python classes targeted for analysts. Following the success of those, I created more cultural programs such as an analyst hackathon, Hipchat/Slack evangelism, and a weekly tech video series. Now that my team has gotten more technical, I am planning out lectures on the agile development process, product management, and data science.
