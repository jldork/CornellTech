I have confidence that Cornell Tech will equip me with both the knowledge and experience necessary to start a technology centered company. The pragmatic curriculum introduces startup fundamentals, provides real problems from real companies, and embeds us in the NYC tech community. Most importantly, Cornell Techâ€™s philosophy that everyone is a builder, that we need to collaborate cross-functionally, and that problems require a multidisciplinary approach resonates with me. I would love to create projects like 'Dream Team,' 'Bowtie.ai,' and 'Thread Learning' as part of a Cornell Tech MBA.
