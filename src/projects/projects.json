    "Jarvis": "Analysis has traditionally been completed on localized software (Excel, SQL Assistant), making it difficult to manage collaborative projects. A team of engineers built Jarvis to solve that problem. Jarvis is a web-based analysis application to makee analysis more transparent and replicable. It allows users to more easily combine SQL querying with Python to unlock new analysis methods and share work between each other.",
    "PandaLP": "PandaLP (short for Pandas Linear Programming) is a Python library that provides a Dataframe abstraction to solve Linear Optimization problems in a simpler way. An example of an optimization problem it solves: How do I assign salaries to people within each team to maximize happiness without going over a budget of $1MM. At Capital One, business analysts often roughly estimate the optimal solutions from their data (conversely, accept suboptimal solutions).",
    "Metadata Information Quotient": "Although metadata is important, leadership did not have a cohesive view of where metadata gaps existed. I created a model in Python that scored metadata, deployed it in AWS, and was able to generate reporst on metadata gaps in our company. With this, leadership was able to embark on a remediation effort and focus their direction.",
    "Role Selection Portal": "Data access requests were a pain point within the analyst community. We created a web tool that vastly simplified the existing access interface and directs analysts to relevant access roles to apply for.",
    "Github Foundations":"Our analysts shared code via email, leading to version control and collaboration issues. Seeing a need, I taught github to analysts for months, and then created a self-led github web course. This course still receives one of the highest satisfaction ratings of internal courses."
